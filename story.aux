\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The grandfather clock rang.\\\\ Rring ring! Rring ring!\\\\ Two giant arms and two heavy fists were cocked back like a revolver. Ready to fire their empty shells - into not-so-empty space. Their rounds ricocheted of bruised walls and bounced around my ears; rattling the ins and outs of my skull.\\\\ Stacks of papers.\\\\ Held down by the night candle and yet hovering over the table edge, rustled ruthlessly.\\\\ Hair.\\\\ Caged in knots and twists, swayed from side to side as the wind picked up its pace.\\\\ Glass Bottles.\\\\ Half full and half empty. Clanked as they rolled past each other; their insides swashing up and down like a ships rum on a stormy night.\\\\ And a glass picture frame. My eyes were met with a loud thud.\\\\ Then a gristly crunch.\\\\ My eyes were fastened shut but I could still picture the wind sweeping away the crime scene; whistling as if nothing took place. }{4}{}\protected@file@percent }
